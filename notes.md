# My Notes  
- A compilation of notes taken during CS 240 class in Winter 2025  

## Ch. 1 Reading  

- use 'javac' in command line to compile Java source code into intermediate machine-independent representation (byte codes) and save it in a class file
- use 'java' in commnad line to launch virtual machine that loads class files and executes byte codes
- ^means you can write once and run anywhere
- can use JShell to test Java code without compiling and running a program
